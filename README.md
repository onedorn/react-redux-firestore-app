## Press this link to check out application [Firebase Hosting](https://react-redux-firestore-app.firebaseapp.com/signin)
 
 It was hell of a road on the way through this app, chelenging but so interesting. I tought lots about `React`, `Reduxe`, tones about `Firebase and Firesote`. I am not a black belted developer so far, but thats brings everything together.
 
 - [x] **npx create-react-app**
